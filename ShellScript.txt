Script file architechture: 
Hardware ==> kernel ==> shell ==> commands 

echo $SHELL ==> for which shell  u r using now 

before executing the file we have to change it as a executable file for that 
     chmod +x myscript.sh // now here the file permission will be changed and also if the user is a root user it wont ask the 
     permission for changing the permission if it is a normal user it will defenetly ask the permission 

#!bin/bash // this is hasbang/shebang the first line for all scripts it indicates that this script is a bash script 

usually in scripting  # indicates that it is a command line but in scripting first line is not a command
